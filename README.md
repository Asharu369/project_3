# Moon Terrain Segmentation üåï

This project focuses on segmenting lunar terrain images to identify hazardous rocks that might pose a threat to lunar rovers. By leveraging deep learning and computer vision, it provides a robust pipeline for preprocessing, training, and deploying a segmentation model.

## üöÄ Key Features
- **UNet with ResNet-34 Backbone**: State-of-the-art architecture for image segmentation with a transfer learning backbone.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves superior performance in predicting hazardous rock locations on lunar surfaces using the Intersection over Union (IoU) metric.
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Automated resizing, normalization, and one-hot encoding for lunar images.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Built-in support for API deployment using FastAPI and visualization through Streamlit.

### Visualize Results
Optionally, use Streamlit to upload images and view the segmented masks:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

##  Training Details

### Dataset
The model was trained on lunar terrain datasets containing labeled images for segmentation. Images were preprocessed to dimensions of 480x480 pixels, normalized, and augmented.

### Model Architecture
- **UNet**: A convolutional neural network tailored for semantic segmentation tasks.
- **Backbone**: ResNet-34 for enhanced feature extraction.
- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling.
- **Loss Function**: Categorical crossentropy combined with IoU metric for precise segmentation.

### Training Pipeline
1. **Preprocessing:**
   - Cropping and resizing images to a consistent size.
   - One-hot encoding for multi-class segmentation masks.
2. **Callbacks:**
   - `EarlyStopping` to prevent overfitting.
   - `ModelCheckpoint` to save the best-performing model.
3. **Metrics:**
   - IoU Score for evaluating segmentation quality.
